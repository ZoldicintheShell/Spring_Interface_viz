# Spring_Interface_viz
A simple interface to play with [mass â¥ˆ spring] system </br>
In this example, we use the Plotly Figure and Scatter classes to create a plot of the position of the mass over time. We use the Streamlit slider function to allow the user to modify the mass, spring constant, and damping coefficient from the app.

We update the Plotly layout to set the x and y axis labels and the plot title. Finally, we use the Streamlit plotly_chart function to display the Plotly figure in the app.

## to run the code:


> streamlit run https://github.com/ZoldicintheShell/Spring_Interface_viz/blob/main/Spring_Interface_viz.py
